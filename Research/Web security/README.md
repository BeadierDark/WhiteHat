# Web Security Research

This repository is divided by the next sections:
+ Presentations, in this folder I share some presentations whose I presented in some conferences
+ Scripts, in this folder you can find some scripts used in my research productions
+ Articles, this folder has my open articles
+ Datasets
+ Frameworks, this folder has some frameworks proposed in the articles, these files (such as the figures) have each step
in order to get the results, so they are different illustrations that could help if someone wants to replicate the process.
